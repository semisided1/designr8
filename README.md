designr8
========

python version of designr8.com

this was the version that never got used, its the same as the previous version but instead of java / s9, it used python and lxml, plus i was working on a post form. but this project got abandoned. i really did not need a template system for the small amount of shared space on pages and i just dont see myself liking 2 pages that look the same. so really i reject xslt for creating webpage templates, i suppose for a db front end that isnt changing a lot xslt internals would be fine but for a blog type web page templates are boring
